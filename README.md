# Financial Data Analyzer
### Goal:
Create a program that can read financial data from a CSV file, process it, then generate basic analytics like total revenue, expenses, and trends.

### Intent:
A project recommended by ChatGPT to provide me with some experience in developing a program in C++. Plan to follow the guidelines and add onto the program in the future.

### Study Topics:
1. Project Structure: main.cpp, header files, source files. How to create a new project and link it to an online repository.

Ran into errors when trying to build the project. Had to redo the structure starting from creating the correct type of project "Console App (C++)". Another issue was that the files that existed were not added to the proper locations in Solution Explorer (files existed, but they need to be added to the appropriate categories).

2. Setting up an Entry Point: The location in a program where execution begins. It's the first piece of code that runs when a program is launched.
3. Namespace common practices to declutter code and avoid name conflicts if multiple libraries define the same function or class names
4. How to manage multiple .cpp files (Only one can have main()).
